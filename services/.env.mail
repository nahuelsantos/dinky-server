# Gmail SMTP Relay Configuration (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
# --------------------------------------------
# Gmail SMTP relay is recommended for improved deliverability and to avoid your
# emails being marked as spam. Most ISPs and cloud providers block outgoing port 25,
# which makes direct mail delivery unreliable.

# To set up Gmail as your SMTP relay:
# 1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 4. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)" - enter "Dinky Server"
# 5. Copy the 16-character password and use it below

# SMTP Relay Settings
SMTP_RELAY_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_RELAY_PORT=587
SMTP_RELAY_USERNAME=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
SMTP_RELAY_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password

# After deployment, test the configuration with:
# docker logs mail-server
# It should show "relay=smtp.gmail.com" in the logs if working properly
